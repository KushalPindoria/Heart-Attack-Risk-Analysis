Heart Attack Risk Analysis in Japan – Power BI Project

Overview:

This project analyzes lifestyle and medical factors contributing to heart attacks in Japan, leveraging Power BI dashboards, DAX measures, and data visualization to identify key risk factors. The goal is to uncover trends and provide data-driven insights for targeted health interventions and policy recommendations.

Features:

Interactive Power BI Dashboard: Analyzes the impact of smoking history, cholesterol levels, BMI, alcohol consumption, and other medical factors on heart attack risk.
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Utilized Power Query to clean missing values, standardize columns, and reshape data for effective visualization.
DAX Measures & Calculations: Built custom measures and calculated columns to provide deep insights into risk patterns.
Filters & Slicers: Users can filter by cholesterol, BMI, age group, region, and gender to explore trends dynamically.

Key Insights:

Smoking history is the leading risk factor for heart attacks.
The highest heart attack occurrences are observed in individuals with moderate cholesterol levels and urban residence.
Certain lifestyle patterns significantly increase risk across demographics.
